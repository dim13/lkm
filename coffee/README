Simple driver for /dev/coffee:

How install it:
---------------
You'll have to change the secure level of the kernel (see securelevel(7)):
In /etc/rc.securelevel: change "securelevel=1" to "securelevel=-1".
Copy coffee.tar.gz in /usr/src/lkm/
untar it.
cd /usr/src/lkm/coffee/
make
make load
Next step: creating the /dev/ entry of the driver:
Do `modstat`, and take the major number of the driver,
`mknod coffee c $MAJOR 0`
That's it.

How it works:
-------------
`echo capuccino > /dev/coffee` puts the Coffee machine plugged on the parallel
         port of the PC on, assuming you've put coffee and water in :) 
`cat /dev/coffee` puts it off.


Good drink. :)
